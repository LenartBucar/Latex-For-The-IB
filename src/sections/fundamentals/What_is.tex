First of all, let's clear up what LaTeX is and what it is not. It is

\begin{itemize}
  \item typesetting system,
  \item programming language focused on macros,
  \item free
\end{itemize}

but it is not

\begin{itemize}
  \item word processor,
  \item text editor,
  \item complicated.
\end{itemize}

In a nutshell, you create a \textit{.tex} file (normal text file with different extension), run a converter and out pops a nicely formatted \textit{.pdf} file. But for the software to know what to do, you need to structure your file appropriately.

Few advantages of LaTeX being mostly text files are that it is lightweight to share and easy to use with version control. And you don't even need graphical interface to edit the files.
