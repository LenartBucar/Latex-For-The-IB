\subsection{Math Mode}

One of \LaTeX{}'s most powerful and recognizable features is its math mode. It's purpose is fairly simple typesetting of equations and formulae that still look professional There are two slightly different types of math mode. First one is inline, which will display equation as a part of the text and looks like this: $x_{1,2} = \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, while the second one is display mode and will show the formula much bigger and isolated, looking like this: $$x_{1,2} = \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ % FIX
